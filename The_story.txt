	Once opon a time there was a cool kid named Tim. He was a great kid. One day he looked in his closit.
	He said, "Who stole my stuff. Where is my catipult."
	"Chiiick, Chicck," Tim hears from under his bed. Some oranges start rolling out from under the bed. Tim falls on the rolling progectiles (oranges). Tim's brother Tom jumps out from under the bed.
